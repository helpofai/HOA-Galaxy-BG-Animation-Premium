fix(admin): Remove duplicate admin menu item

- The "Galaxy Background" settings menu was appearing twice in the admin panel.
- This was caused by a redundant `is_admin()` check in the `HOA_Galaxy_Background` class constructor. The constructor was already being called within an `is_admin()` block in the main plugin file.
- Removing the unnecessary conditional from the constructor resolves the duplication.
