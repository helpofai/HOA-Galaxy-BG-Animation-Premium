refactor: Modernize plugin structure and code

- Refactor the plugin to use a modern PHP structure with namespaces and separate class files.
- Introduce strict typing and type declarations for improved code quality.
- Separate the view logic from the business logic by moving HTML to template files.
- Update the main plugin file to load the new structure.
- Bump the plugin version to 3.0.0.
